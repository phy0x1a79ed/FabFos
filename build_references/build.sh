# Compile the build_references transform library's _metadata/ indexes.
#
# Two type directories, not one. LoadTypeLibraries keys a namespace off the YAML
# filename stem and RAISES on a duplicate, so a `ref.yml` here would collide with
# the shipped library's. The split falls out of that:
#
#   src/metasmith_libraries/data_types/   env:: lib:: ncbi:: sequences:: annotation::
#                                         ref:: fabfos::    -- shared, run-side too
#   build_references/data_types/          raw:: interm:: bench:: buildlib::
#                                                            -- build-only
#
# A new type that a RUN-side transform will consume (ref::mnxr_lookup, say) belongs
# in the shipped library, not here.
#
# The same split applies to CODE, which is why there are two uniques loops below.
# `lib::` (submodule) ships in the wheel because a fosmid run executes it; `buildlib::`
# does not, because nothing in it runs outside a reference compile. Shipping the
# reaction-universe mappers and the thermodynamics ensemble to someone who installed
# FabFos to assemble fosmids is the thing that split is there to prevent.
#
# The shipped library's own transform dirs are rebuilt too: they carry their own
# pruned copy of the type graph under transforms/*/_metadata/types/, so a change to
# ref.yml that they reference does not reach them until they are recompiled.
