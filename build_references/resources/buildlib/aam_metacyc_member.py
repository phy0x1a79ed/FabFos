"""Curated member: MetaCyc ``atom-mappings-smiles.dat``, joined to MNXR.

The third AAM ensemble member, and the first NON-NEURAL one. RXNMapper and
LocalMapper are both transformers trained on reaction SMILES -- when they agree
part of the agreement is shared architectural bias, not independent confirmation
(the ``NEURAL_SHARED_FLOOR`` discount in ``combine_aam.py``). MetaCyc is a curated
database, not a model, so it is a genuinely INDEPENDENT vote: it corroborates the
neural pair at full weight when it agrees and is a finding, not noise, when it does
not -- the exact role BioCyc plays against the correlated thermo pair in the
directionality ensemble (``direction/curated.py``).

WHY THE SMILES FILE, NOT THE INDEX FILE. A prior round treated the curated member as
blocked -- "a MetaCyc ATOM-MAPPINGS decoder is absent from committed code and would
have to be re-derived", plus a ``classes.dat`` blocker on carrier formulae. Both apply
to the OTHER decode route (``atom-mapping.dat`` INDICES resolved against per-compound
formulae). ``atom-mappings-smiles.dat`` sidesteps both: it is already mapped reaction
SMILES in the exact ``[C:n]...>>...`` form the engine's ``pairs_from_mapped`` consumes,
and R-groups are embedded in the SMILES so no missing formulae are needed. No decoder;
the file IS the decode.

DROP-IN. ``load_member`` returns ``{mnxr -> (mapped_rxn_smiles, confidence)}`` -- the
same shape ``combine_aam.load_mapper`` returns for a cached neural member -- with
``confidence`` = ``CURATED_CONFIDENCE`` for every reaction (a curated map is not scored;
it is asserted). The mapped SMILES then flow through the engine's own
``pairs_from_mapped`` unchanged, exactly like a neural member's cached SMILES, so the
only thing that varies between members is the mapping, never the identity bookkeeping.

THE CROSS-NAMESPACE CAVEAT (measured downstream, not here). MetaCyc's per-metabolite
molecules must anchor to the MNXR's MetaNetX participants inside ``pairs_from_mapped``'s
``match_mols`` (canonical-SMILES match) and the template-count check. Where MetaCyc and
MetaNetX disagree on a reaction's participant set (protons/water/generic frames written
differently) the reaction comes back ``stripped`` or ``no_pairs`` -- SAFE (never a wrong
pair) but it lowers coverage. That split is measured in ``combine_aam``'s status report,
not silently folded into agreement.

Standalone: ``python metacyc_member.py --out metacyc_aam.tsv`` materialises the member as
a cached TSV (``mnxr, mapped_rxn_smiles, confidence``) so it is inspectable and matches the
"member = cached TSV" abstraction the neural members already use. Runs under any env with
pandas (no rdkit needed for the join; rdkit is only used by the combiner).
