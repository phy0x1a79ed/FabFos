"""The direction ensemble's frozen constants.

The build-side mirror of ``src/fabfos/canon.py``'s ``DIR_*`` block, carried here because
a transform's driver runs in a conda env holding rdkit and equilibrator, not the fabfos
package -- there is no import path from inside the run to the CLI's canon module.

The two copies are checked against each other by ``build_references/check_references.py``
rather than trusted to stay in step by convention: they are the same numbers used at two
different times (this one to COMPUTE a ratio, canon.py's to VALIDATE a table that carries
one), and a silent divergence would produce a table that passes its own validator while
meaning something else.

Every value below is committed BEFORE a run, which is what makes them constants rather
than fitted parameters. ``DIR_SIGMA_0`` is the one exception in kind and says so.
