"""Encoding and bake identity for the compiled metabolism reference tables.

Ported from the pre-library ``build_references/refs.py``, with one change: every
path constant is gone. The original opened ``data/raw/mnxref-4_5/atom_pairs.parquet``
and wrote ``data/reference/metabolism/`` by name, which is exactly the coupling the
transform library removes -- a transform is handed its inputs and told where its
outputs go, and a module that knows a repo layout cannot run inside one. Functions
that used to default to a constant now take the path.

The compiled tables are three parquet files:

    vocab.parquet        int-code vocabulary, 5 kinds
    atom_pairs.parquet   the atom-atom mapping
    direction.parquet    per-reaction directionality

They are ONE artifact in three files. Each carries the same bake-identity block in its
parquet file-level key-value metadata, and :func:`assert_same_bake` refuses a set whose
blocks disagree -- because ``atom_pairs`` stores metabolites as integer codes, reading it
against a different bake's ``vocab`` decodes every node to the wrong metabolite and
raises nothing at all.

Node codes
----------
A node is ``(metabolite, canonical_atom_rank)``, and the compile path wants it as a
single integer so edges can be factorised without tuples::

    node_code = met_code << rank_bits | atom_rank

That packing happens at LOAD time, not at rest. On disk the two fields stay separate
(``tail_met`` / ``tail_rank``), because fusing them makes every value distinct and
destroys the run-length dictionary encoding parquet gets on a 34k-symbol metabolite
column: measured on the real table, packed-at-rest is 16.75 MB against 9.71 MB split,
while packing at load costs 4 ms. :func:`pack_pairs` does it on the way in.

``met_bits`` and ``rank_bits`` are MEASURED at bake time from the vocabulary and the
observed maximum rank, never hardcoded, and recorded in the identity block. Getting
``rank_bits`` too small is the dangerous failure: the rank field bleeds into the
metabolite field, two distinct atoms merge into one node, and the merge RAISES the
network's conductance -- it looks like an improvement. Hence the assertion at bake time
and the width check on every load.

Ratios stay float64
-------------------
``pair_w`` and ``confidence`` narrow to float32 (~3e-8 relative, four orders below the
spread of the evidence weights they multiply). ``ratio`` does NOT. The consumer's flip
test is a threshold at exactly 1.0, and four reactions in the real table sit within
float32 epsilon of it (e.g. MNXR112716 at 1.0000000000016507): narrowing silently
reorients those four edges. A re-encoding may not change topology.

Orientation
-----------
``atom_pairs`` stores tail/head exactly as the source table writes substrate/product.
The ``ratio > 1`` edge flip stays a consumer-side operation (see
``ecspr_build.graph_from_pairs``): 10,485 of the 83,796 ratios exceed 1, so a bake that
pre-flipped would double-apply against a consumer that also flips, silently restoring
the unfavoured direction.

Build side, not run side
------------------------
This module lives in ``buildlib::`` because everything that calls it today compiles a
reference. :func:`compile_atom_graph` is the exception in kind -- it READS a finished
bake -- and it is here because the reference gate is what calls it, to check the compiled
tables against ``ecspr_build.graph_from_pairs`` on the string tables. When a run-side
transform first needs to read a bake, that half moves to ``lib::``; until then, shipping
it in the wheel would ship a reader nothing calls.
