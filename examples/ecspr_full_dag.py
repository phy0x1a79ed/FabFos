"""Render the FULL ECSPr workflow DAG: reference inserts -> significance.

This is the method's shape, drawn by the planner rather than by hand. It is
also the worked template for calling metasmith directly when the `fabfos`
CLI's single canonical path is not what you want -- it stages typed inputs,
picks the lanes, builds a target set, and asks the planner to resolve it.

Run it:

    PYTHONPATH=src python examples/ecspr_full_dag.py --dag reports/dag/ecspr_full

Planning does NOT require the staged files to exist; the planner resolves on
types and lineage. So this renders on a machine that has none of the 46 GB.
A real run obviously does need them.

The lane is selected here, and the choice is deliberate rather than
structural: `ecsprAtomB` builds the atom-transfer graph from the experiment's
own annotation evidence. THREE domains produce `ecspr::atom_graph` --
`ecsprAtomB`, `ecsprAtomA` (a curated GEM) and `ecsprAtomGPR` (a GEM plus an
active gene set) -- so loading two would let the planner pick by tiebreak.
Which lane runs is a claim about the method, so it is made here, explicitly,
and recorded in the method id.

The STAR lane was retired on 2026-07-20. On that topology a metabolite was a
single node joined to reaction-node HUBS, and eliminating a reaction node --
which is what the Woodbury update does -- left a CLIQUE over its participants,
so two participants sharing no atom still got a conductance. Here a node IS an
atom and an edge IS an atom transfer.

Where each staged input comes from is reported at the end, split into items
resolved through the data library and items still resolved from an absolute
path in the incumbent tree. That second list is the honest remaining gap
between this method and one that runs on another machine.
