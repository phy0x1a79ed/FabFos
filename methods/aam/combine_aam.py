"""AAM ensemble combiner -- fuse multiple atom-atom mappers into one correspondence
table with provenance, mirroring the directionality ensemble (``direction/combine.py``).

The atom lane's universe is currently single-source: ``atom_pairs_universe.parquet`` is
RXNMapper-only with no record of who mapped what. This makes the universe an ensemble:
each member proposes, per (reaction, element, substrate-atom), a product-atom, and the
members are fused in a common identity space with the correlation structure made explicit
and the provenance recorded, never selected -- exactly the pattern the direction combiner
uses for ΔG'.

Common space. Every member's correspondence is expressed in the engine's canonical-rank
identity: ``(metabolite, CanonicalRankAtoms(breakTies=True))`` is an atom, invariant to how
a reaction happened to write the molecule. Because the identity is a property of the
metabolite, not the mapper, two mappers that map the same physical atom name the same node.
We obtain each member's correspondence by running the engine's own ``pairs_from_mapped`` on
that member's mapped SMILES -- one extractor, so the only thing that varies between members
is the mapping, not the identity bookkeeping.

Correlation structure (the load-bearing design fact, mirrored from direction's TAU_SHARED).
RXNMapper and LocalMapper are both transformers trained on reaction SMILES: when they agree,
part of the agreement is shared architectural bias, not independent confirmation. So
neural-neural agreement is DISCOUNTED (``NEURAL_SHARED_FLOOR``) -- two correlated members
cannot count as two independent ones, the direct analogue of the thermo vote flooring
eQ+dGbyG. A curated member (Rhea/MetaCyc atom maps) is a database, not a transformer -- so
when it exists it breaks ties and carries undiscounted weight. (Not wired this round; see
the README.)

Abstain-by-dilution (the shrink-to-no-op analogue). Where members DISAGREE on an atom's
fate, the correspondence is not decided by majority or confidence -- it is DILUTED across the
disputed products by member weight, so a contested atom spreads its transfer rather than
committing. This is the same fanout dilution the atom graph already applies to name-ambiguous
pairs (``pairs_from_mapped``'s ``ambiguous_diluted``), extended across mappers. An atom no
member maps simply has no pair -- the AAM analogue of ratio 1.0.

Provenance. Every emitted pair carries ``method`` / ``source`` / ``confidence`` -- a record of
which members spoke and how they agreed, NOT a tier that gates usability (every pair is used).

This driver fuses an ORDERED set of members, each ``{mnxr -> (mapped_smiles, confidence)}``,
and reports PAIRWISE agreement between every pair of members over the atoms both address.
Two families of member exist and are treated differently by design:

  * NEURAL (RXNMapper, LocalMapper) -- transformers on reaction SMILES. Their mutual
    agreement is partly shared architectural bias, so a purely-neural consensus is
    DISCOUNTED (``NEURAL_SHARED_FLOOR``) and their agreement rate measures how little
    independent information a second neural member adds.
  * CURATED (MetaCyc, ``metacyc_member.py``) -- a database, not a model, so an INDEPENDENT
    vote. A curated-inclusive consensus fuses UNDISCOUNTED (full ``1.0``) via the existing
    ``set(present) <= NEURAL_MEMBERS`` branch, and curated-vs-neural agreement is the "does
    the curated source argue with the neural mappers" number.

Pure re-extraction over cached / curated mapped SMILES; runs anywhere rdkit + the engine
import (``scadc-metabolic-model``). Drop ``--no-metacyc`` to reproduce the original
two-member neural demonstration.
